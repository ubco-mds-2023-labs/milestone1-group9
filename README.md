# AirBnB Dashboard
## Developers: Baldeep Dhada, Somya Nagar, Eden Chen, Jade Yu

The app has a landing page that shows a map with points that represent a listing on AirBnB. Each listing will have a link to the corresponding page on the AirBnB website along with a description of the unit and the host. On the left half The user can filter by City/neighbourhood using a drop down menu and can adjust the price with a slider. The number of listings and the map change accordingly to the filters. There are multiple tabs on the top of the page that allows the user to switch between the pages. The second page has a violin plot that shows the density of price for each room type which can be filtered by ratings by a slider underneath the bar. Scrolling down the second page will display a bar plot that shows each city on the x-axis and the ratings on the y-axis which can be filtered by room type by using a radio button underneath it. The app is developed using official AirBnB data.
