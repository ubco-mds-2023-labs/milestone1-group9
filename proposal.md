# Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data analysts for Airbnb

Target audience: Travelers visiting Canada

In recent years, the price of housing even for holiday stays in Canada has seen a great increase and cost city visitors a large amount of money. If we could understand the Airbnb listings' properties via thorough data analysis and figure out what are some of the ideal accommodation locations for visitors with different needs, it may be a relief for those with no clue about the choice of Airbnb. To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that allows travelers to visually explore and narrow down the range of choices. This dashboard could be used to shed light on questions such as examining how many Airbnb listings are available in a certain neighborhood and their specific geographical locations, prices and so on.

# Description of the data

We will be visualizing the Airbnb dataset up to 2024 which has 38,534 instances of Airbnb listings. 

Each instance has 19 variables, highlighting different aspects of the listing to better understand the Airbnb market across Canada. These include:

1. the host information (`host_id`, `host_name`)

2. the instance id of each listing (`id`)

3. the location information (`city`, `neighbourhood`, `latitude`, `longtitude`)

4. the property information (`room_type`, `minimum_nights`, `price`)

5. the feedback information (`rating`, `number_of_reviews`, `last_review`)

# Research questions and usage scenarios

More specifically, the dashboard aims to provide insights into the five following areas:

1. How is the Airbnb listings distributed geographically across Canada according to price range?

2. What are the characteristics of Airbnb listings across geographical regions? (e.g. room type, price, minimum nights permitted, link to the listing page)

3. What is the price distribution of different room types?

4. How is the listing ratings distributed across different neighborhoods and cities?

A group of UK tourists planning a trip to Canada faced challenges finding suitable accommodations despite abundant online information. They sought help from Airbnb data analysts, outlining their need for comfortable, safe, and affordable lodgings near desired attractions. Utilizing data and filtering tools, we pinpointed accommodations meeting their criteria, identifying trends in timing, location, and accommodation types. Ultimately, we successfully matched them with ideal stays, enhancing their vacation experience.
